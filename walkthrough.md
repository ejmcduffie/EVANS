# Walkthrough for EVANS App Chainlink Hackathon Demo

## Introduction
This script guides users through the core workflow of the EVANS app, highlighting key functionalities for demo purposes. Ensure deployment issues are resolved first (e.g., install '@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades' if needed).

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough
1. **Fix Deployment Issue (if applicable)**: Check hardhat.config.js and install missing plugins to avoid errors like 'upgrades' being undefined.
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Run `deploy-fresh.js` or `deploy-with-wallet.js` to set up the contract.
3. **Verify the Wallet**: Execute `verify-wallet.js` to confirm wallet configuration.
4. **Check ANC Balance**: Use `check-balance.js` to view the balance, which defaults to $100 for new users.
5. **Demonstrate Core Functionality**: Interact with the app to show Chainlink integration (e.g., data fetching or oracle usage, if implemented) and test the workflow.

## Notes
- This is a draft; refine based on actual app behavior.
- For hackathon demo, emphasize smooth transitions between steps.
